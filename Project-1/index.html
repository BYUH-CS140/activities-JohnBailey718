        <p>Welcome to my online Photo Tour of Texas. This Photo Tour will show some of the many different places in the Great State of Texas
            and some of the places that I went to growing up. While most of the more well know places to go to in Texas are resuraunts or other 
            food places there is still many places that are not as well know.
