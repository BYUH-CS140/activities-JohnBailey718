            Dogs come in many different shapes and sizes. Some are small like Chihuahuas, while others are large like
            Great Danes.
            They all have unique personalities. Most dogs love to play fetch, chew on toys, and cuddle with their
            owners.
            A dog's wagging tail usually means they are happy to see you.
