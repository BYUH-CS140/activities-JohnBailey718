    <h1>John Bailey</h1>
    <h3>If you were a boat, what type of boat would you be?</h3>
    <p>If I were a boat I would be a Jet Boat. 
        I think this because my thoughts will go all over the place 
        very quickly and will go back and forth between ideas very fast.
    Just like a Jet Boat. Very fast and can go all over the water.</p>
